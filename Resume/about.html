            <p class="about-text">
                I started my education as a software engineer at the University of Southern Denmark (Odense campus) in 2017</br>
                Here the focus was to learn the basics of programming (datatypes, common practice and the like)</br>
                The primary focus of the education has been learning software architecture, patterns and good practices in development</br>
                All of this has been taught using primarily Java and JavaScript which ofcourse has made me most confident in these</br>
                languages as most of my experience lies here

            <h3>Firefirhgter at Fack Ballerup</h3>
            <p class="about-text">
                Some people like to do sports a few times a week others like to take a bike ride around town.</br>
                I like to help out my local community by working part time as a firefighter.</br>
                This gives me great pleasure as I can help prevent homes from being burned down to the grownd or help save or two.</br>
                It can be challenging at times but the good clearly outweighs the bad.</br>
                This job is not only benefitial for me but can also benefit my full time employer as my firefighting experience helps me keep my</br>
                head cool in times of emergency.</br>
                This afcourse also affects my capabilities in stressfull situations aswell as late night work.
